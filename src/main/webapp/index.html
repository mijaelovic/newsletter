REST API<br/>

1. Category submissions, a category has a unique code, a title and optionally a parent category (e.g. science -> physics)<br/>
<pre>
POST /categories
{
    “code”: “string”,
    “title”: “string”,
    “superCategoryCode”: “string” or null
}
</pre>

2. Book submissions, a book has a title and a list of category codes of categories to which it belongs to
<pre>
POST /books
{
    “title”: “string”,
    “categoryCodes”: [
        “code1”,
        “code2”,
        ...
    ]
}
</pre>

3. Subscriber submissions, a subscriber has an email and a list of category codes of categories for which he/she is interested in
<pre>
POST /subscribers
{
    “email”: “string”,
    “categoryCodes”: [
        “code1”,
        “code2”,
        ...
    ]
}
</pre>

4. Return a list of “newsletters”, each newsletter relates to a subscriber, a newsletter has a recipient address (the subscriber's email) and a list of notifications, each notification contains the name of a book and a list of categoryPaths for it, a categoryPath is a list that shows the relation of the books' category and the category for which a subscriber is interested.
A subscriber should get notifications for books that belong to the same category or to a child category of a category in which the subscriber is interested.
To make it a bit easier assume that a book can not belong to a parent and child category at the same time, for example if science is the parent category of physics then a book can not belong to both categories, only to one of them, same holds for a subscription.
Also assume that the release date of a book is irrelevant and that all books are eligible for a newsletter.

Example:
Given the following category hierarchy:
science └──engineering
└── software
├── functional_programming
└── object_oriented_programming
If a subscriber is interested in engineering and a book e.g. “Programming in Scala” belongs to the category functional_programming, then one of the categoryPaths for that book in that subscriber's email notification is:
["engineering", "software", "functional_programming"]
if the same book also belongs to the category object_oriented_programming then that same book has also a categoryPath:
["engineering", "software", "object_oriented_programming"] and the /newsletters response body should be:
[

<pre>
GET /newsletters
{
    “recipient”: “subscriber@email.com”,
    “notifications”: [
        {
            "book": "Programming in Scala",
            "categoryPaths": [
                ["engineering", "software", "functional_programming"],
                ["engineering", "software", "object_oriented_programming"]
            ]
        }
    ]
}
</pre>
</body>
